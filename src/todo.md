[X] - There's a bug with the acquisition of the first scroll
    - The origin of the bug lies in the fact that the code is shit
    - the way I am invoking the UI is a full antipattern
    - What I should do is have the UI as a smart component/object
    - That I can call functions on 
    - As opposed to searching for children from main, that's crazy

FIXEEEED
    
[ ] - When capturing the second scroll
        - the ghost should not appear again - GAMESTATE
        - the UI should update - DONE 
        - the scroll should disappear - 
        - the player should not be able to trigger the scene any longer - GAMESTATE
