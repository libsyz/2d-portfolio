## Todo 

[] I need a new concept for the intro scene
[] How am I going to handle mobile users? 
[] Fix Tutorial - should not show the gamepad




-- Intro Scene -- 

[X] Add fadein function
[X] Have 1 second delay until ninja comes in for drama effect
 
-- House --

[X] Player should not be able to shoot in the bedroom
[X] need to improve bounds
[X] Apartment house background is white - should be the same color as the rest of the scenario 
[X] Game Crashes when player interacts with tarifa painting
[X] Elias should stop the patrol when in touch with the player


## Bugs

[ ] 



[ ] Lightining scroll does not disappear when obtained

[] Layering - When the player passes close to a tree, he should go under it and not over it 

[] Upper corner of the forest is wrong

[] When the user comes out of a building, the screen should not roll

## Code quality 

[X] Create a factory that manages baddy creation and cleans up the code

[ ] DialogShow should be DialogBubbleShow or something like that

## Nice to haves

[] Baddie should face the player when casting fireball

[] Improve rendering of dialogues to prevent blinking between event/phase changes

[] In the bedroom, it would be cool if you could change colors in the wardrobe and keep it throughout the game 

[] Add Coworkers talking to one another on the coffee area of the office

[] Player Dance/Celebrate animation when scroll is obtained
